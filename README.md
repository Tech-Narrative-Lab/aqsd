The Air Quality and Sustainable Distancing sprint is exploring ways to make physical distancing sustainable, and understand applications/implications. The Sensor Platform effort is prototyping a collection of different sensor capabilities â€“ CO2 levels, motion sensing, object recognition, atmospheric data. The goal is to look at different capabilities and experiment with ways to get actionable data.
